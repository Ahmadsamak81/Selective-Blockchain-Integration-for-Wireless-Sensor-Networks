Selective Blockchain Integration for WSN

Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain blockchain framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with dynamic criticality-based routing and Merkle anchoring.

Overview

This project implements a selective blockchain integration strategy that balances data integrity and energy efficiency in resource-constrained WSNs.

Instead of storing all data on-chain (high energy cost) or relying solely on databases (weak integrity), the proposed hybrid approach:

Routes high-criticality packets to blockchain

Protects normal readings using Merkle-anchored off-chain storage

Adapts routing decisions based on real-time energy and data semantics

Key Results (S1 Scenario)

🔐 92.2% tamper detection

⚡ 43.1% energy reduction vs. full blockchain

🔄 91.1% reduction in on-chain transactions

⏳ 1.78× network lifetime extension

Technical Highlights

Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus (3 validators)

8:1 Merkle batch compression

8-component detailed energy model

Strict post-commit tampering attack model

100-node WSN simulation (3000 rounds, 10 Monte Carlo runs)

Purpose

This implementation supports research on energy-aware blockchain integration in WSNs, demonstrating that selective integration achieves Pareto-optimal security-efficiency trade-offs
